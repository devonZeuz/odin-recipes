    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Voluptate doloribus id ea quam doloremque consectetur neque, temporibus laudantium mollitia numquam beatae unde, officia debitis dignissimos. Accusamus, dolores ex! Officiis, fuga.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup garlic cloves, peeled (about 1 head)</li>
        <li>3 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream, half-and-half, or crème fraîche</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to follow</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In a small saucepan, bring the garlic and oil to a boil, then turn the heat to low and cook uncovered for 5 minutes, or until the garlic is lightly browned. Turn off the heat and set aside. The garlic will continue to cook in the oil.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place the potatoes in a large pot of salted water, bring to a boil, and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until the potatoes are very tender. With a slotted spoon, remove the potatoes from the water, reserving the cooking water, and remove the garlic from the oil, reserving the oil.</li>
        <li>Process the potatoes and garlic through a food mill fitted with the medium disc. Add the reserved olive oil, 2 teaspoons of salt, the pepper, cream, and 3/4 cup of the cooking water to the potatoes and mix with a wooden spoon. Add more cooking water, if necessary, until the potatoes are creamy but still firm. Season to taste and serve hot.</li>
    </ul>
